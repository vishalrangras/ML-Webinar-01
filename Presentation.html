# Machine Learning - 1

**Conventional Programming:** 

* The programmer understands the business logic and code it in programming language.

**Machine Learning:**

* Useful when it is **hard to code business logic** manually
* The idea is to **code learning algorithms** which can **learn** the business logic from **data**
* Useful only with good amount of **useful (correct) data**
* Data and models (algorithms), both are equally important to understand
* **Statistics** is huge part of ML - Khan Academy

# Machine Learning - 2

#### Basic Categorization

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervises Learning
* Semi-Supervised Learning

#### Tasks in Supervised Learning

* **Classification** - Predict discrete value output / Predict from fixed number of categories
* **Regression** - Predict continuous value output

# Classification - Examples

1. Old vs. New Drill Bit Classification
2. Spam vs. No Spam
3. Fraud vs. No Fraud
4. Claim approval vs. rejection
5. Document/Image/Content classification and tagging
6. Revenue vs. No Revenue - Online Shopping, Bank Term Plan, Insurance, Sales
